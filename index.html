        <h2>Our Javascript Vocab</h2>
        <ul>
          <li id="JS">Javascript <span id="JSDEF"><br> A coding language. This is used for writing logic functions and is a powerful tool for developers of all levels.</span></li>
          <li id="ops">Operators <span id="opsdef"><br> A special character that indicate an action to be performed. They can be assignment operators, which assign a value to a variable, or a comparison operator, which compares the values of two variables.</span></li>
          <li id="var">Variables <span id="vardef"><br>A variable is what stores data which Javascript will use later to either manipulate or determine the outcome of a function. In modern Javascript a variable is "declared" with either "let" which means the variable can (and most likely will) be changed at some point, or "const" which means the variable is a fixed value or data type and cannot and will not ever change.</span></li>
          <li id="func">Functions<span id="funcdef"><br>A function is block of code designed to perform a specific tast. Most functions are custom written to the developers needs.</span></li>
          <li id="meth">Methods<span id="methdef"><br>Similar to a function, a method is a block of code that performs a tast. However, a method is associated with an object whereas a function is not. There are many built in methods in javascript. For example, the method '.toUpperCase() returns string data in all uppercase letters.</span></li>
          <li id="arg">Argument<span id="argdef"><br>An argument the the value passed to and received by a function</span></li>
          <li id="param">Parameter<span id="paramdef"><br>Where an argument is the actual value passed to a function, a parameter is the names listed in the function definition. Functions do not necessarily need parameters depending on the task they are being written to perform.</span></li>
          <li id="return">Return<span id="returndef"><br>A return is the value or data that is literally returned to the user when the function is executed</span></li>
          <li id="chain">Chaining methods<span id="chaindef"><br>This refers to a style of cascading code in which two or more methods are called on a single object in succession</span></li>
          <li id="string">String Data<span id="stringdef"><br>A data type which exists as text. While this data type can be manipulated and chained together, it will not accept mathematical operations. However, arabic numerals may be converted to a Number data type which then can be used for mathematical operations</span></li>
          <li id="bool">Boolean<span id="booldef"><br>A boolean is a data type that is either true or false.</span></li>
          <li id="undef">Undefined<span id="undefdef"><br>When a variable has not yet been assigned any date, or even yet be declared, it is considered "undefined".</span></li>
          <li id="nan">NaN<span id="nandef"><br>NaN is an abbreviation of Not A Number.</span></li>
          <li id="alert">Alert<span id="alertdef"><br>This is a simple method, it literally just shows a dialogue box at the top of the screen that contains any message put in by the programmer. It is not recommended for regular use, however it can be a helpful tool for testing out code and functions in the browser</span></li>
          <li id="comment">Comment<span id="commentdef"><br>Often when writing code, we will want text to be in the script that is not read by the program as code. These can be anything from notes to the programmer themself regarding bugs they need to come back to, notes to other programmers letting them know what a certain line of code or function does or does not do, or to clearly seperate one type of code from another (Business v User Logic, eg). Also, there will be times when you want a part of your code to stop running in order to test out a single other part. In this case it is helpful to "comment out" that code so the program doesn't read it as code.</span></li>
          <li id="jquery">jQuery<span id="jquerydef"><br>An incredibly stupid and profoundly frustrating Javascript library. In theory, it is supposed to make life easier. In reality, this could not be further from the truth as it is confusing to most novices and nerfs the coding process too much. When beginner coders should be learning how to write their own custom functions, jQuery is there to confuse them and take away a valuable learning opportunity. Most programmers will concede that it is an easy and simple way to see their code interact with their html and css pages in real time, but that is a steep price to pay.</span></li>
          <li id="attrib">Attribute<span id="attribdef"><br>A jQuery method that returns the attributed value of a selected element</span></li>
